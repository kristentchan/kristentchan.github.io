            <h6>IN THE BEGINNING...</h6>
            <p>...of a cozy San Diego winter, three classmates and I ventured to create a website.</p>
            <p>After searching and emailing for clients, the manager of Audrey's met with us at the end of January and we began the process of creating the never-before seen Dr. Seuss themed coffee website to accompany a novel coffee shop. Anyone who has read or seen a Dr. Seuss composition can say that its theme is poles apart from the average Instagram picture. Our team decided to take on the challenge of inserting the playful, quirky and unconventional into a technological era of modernity, aesthetic, and convention.</p><img class="a1" src="resources/a1.jpg" hspace="20" vspace="10">
            <p>Audrey's Caf&#233 was named after Audrey Geisel, also known as Mrs. Seuss, because of the $3 million she donated for its renovation. The library in which it is located was dedicated to Theodore Geisel, the author and creator of Dr. Seuss. Inside contains the largest collections of his precious works of art, manuscripts and memorabilia.</p>
            <p>The current Audrey's page was embedded in the UCSD website but not even listed in the main navigation. The site adopted the scholarly format of a college informational page, limiting its brand to no more than a splash of orange and yellow in the title.</p><a href="resources/a2.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-cent" src="resources/a2.png" vspace="10"></a>
            <p>Using extensive interviews with both the client and users, we found a list of needs:</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:.5%">For the Client</p>
                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>Establish unique personality, brand and its goal to be student-centered</li>
                    <li>Have a larger internet presence</li>
                    <li>Practically show hours, location, deals and the menu</li>
                    <li>Means for users to provide feedback</li>
                </ul>
            <p style="margin-bottom:.5%">For the User</p>
                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>Photos of seating space, drinks and general atmosphere</li>
                    <li>Convenient and accessible hours and menu</li>
                    <li>Available deals, promotions and featured drinks</li>
                    <li>Address the needs of specific personas</li>
                </ul>
            <h6>SITE ARCHITECTURE</h6>
            <p>Starting from scratch, we quickly mapped out the structure and potential content, making sure to keep our target audience's goals in mind.</p>
            <a href="resources/a3.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-cent" src="resources/a3.png"></a>
            <h6>ADDRESSING CLIENT AND USER NEEDS</h6>
            <img align="right" class="a1" src="resources/a4.png" hspace="20" vspace="10"><p>During our competitive analysis of other coffee websites like Coffee Supreme, we saw a trend of subliminal hints of a brand's color. For example, the stack of red cups among other relatively black and white objects makes the user aware of it, even if it is not the main focus of the picture. We applied this concept by putting washes of Audrey's bold yellow and orange in our pictures in order to complement the caf&#233's walls and furniture. To kill two birds with one stone, we presented the seating area and ambiance for the users' needs while frankly exhibiting the distinctive brand for our client. Because Dr. Seuss is a central theme to both the caf&#233 and the library, we incorporated this into each page by adding lively pastel colors to highlight our text boxes while pointing viewers to its main selling points.</p>
            <p>As an on-campus coffee shop, the mantra "for the students and by the students" makes Audrey's purpose for online presence different from other's. We conveyed this objective through our pictures of the staff and in our choice to add a contact page. Users can empathize with the pictures of students working and studying, and identify themselves in the motto. To attract the students and users it serves, the contact page allows for a quick and approachable way to submit inquiries and to remain connected through email.</p>
            <p>With these ways to address the needs, we created a few paper prototypes, translating them into low-fidelity mockups of both <a href="https://invis.io/SBAK576JN" target="_blank">desktop</a> and <a href="https://invis.io/SXAK567WZ" target="_blank">mobile</a>.</p>

            <h6>FINAL PRODUCT</h6>
            <p>We coded our final product from scratch using Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. Take a look at this <a href="https://audreyscafe.github.io/index.html">funky website</a>!</p>
            <video class="a5" autoplay="autoplay" loop="true" id="vid">
              <source src="resources/a5.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <p>For both the user and client, a quick glance at the header image would give all the necessary information needed to visit the location. In addition, the first suggestion of the site is to look at the menu, answering the essential question: "What do I want to drink?".</p>
            <p>To add solidarity between the website and the caf&#233, we chose the fonts "Rubik" and "Karla" which match the whimsical brand of Audrey's. They retain the quality and the leisure of Audrey's own logo font, "This Font is Bold", while also being clear and legible.</p>
            <h6>MOBILE MENU DESIGN</h6>
            <video class="a6" autoplay="autoplay" loop="true" id="vid2">
              <source src="resources/a6.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <p>While designing mobile first, we took a look at many competitors' styles for menus. Some had downloadable PDF menus and some (like <a href="http://www.betterbuzzcoffee.com/menu" target="_blank">Better Buzz</a>) had an unceasing list on a webpage. However, to cater to the students rushing to class and for mobile convenience, we wanted to avoid downloading or scrolling past every single item. A condensed and expandable menu fit perfectly, allowing the user to go straight to the section desired, shortening searches and removing download time.</p>
            <h6>REFLECTIONS</h6>
            <p>As the first project undertaken for a client professionally, this experience taught me much about working with specifications and satisfying user needs. The critique we received from presenting our need finding results, competitive analyses, and product to our professor was some of the best feedback and greatly improved my design theory. I learned how to unearth and create personas, and evaluate heuristics studied in earlier classes. Before this project, I barely scratched the surface front-end coding. Gladly jumping in head first, I became one of the main developers in this project. The most impactful fruit of this undertaking was the enhancing my coding abilities in both HTML and CSS. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of working with my partners to make my first functioning website and I endeavor to continue enhancing my capacity in web development.</p>
